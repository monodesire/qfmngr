==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                          *qfmngr-introduction*

The QuickFix Manager plugin provides a simple user interface for saving and
loading QuickFix lists to/from disk. Read about QuickFix here: |quickfix|

So, if you have filled up a QuickFix list (with e.g. a compilation or a grep
result) and want to access it at a later time, you can, with help of this
plugin, save it to disk into a text file. While saving, you give it a save
name, so you easily can identify each saved QuickFix list when you load them
later.

Vim does have built-in support for remembering multiple QuickFix lists, but
only up to ten lists, and you cannot give them individual names, so it's
harder to keep track of what's in what list. A bit rudimentary so to speak.
See |quickfix-error-lists| for more information about Vim's built-in support.


==============================================================================
2. Requirements                                          *qfmngr-requirements*

This plugin has been tested with Vim 7.3 in a Linux environment. Only the
regular text-based Vim has been used in this testing, not gVim. There are
probably no special requirements for this plugin to work.


==============================================================================
3. Installation                                          *qfmngr-installation*

The installation of this plugin is simple. The official guidelines are found
here: |add-global-plugin|

In an essence, you need to copy qfmngr.vim (the actual plugin code) and
qfmngr.txt (the help file) to somewhere in your |'runtimepath'|. For a
standard Unix environment, this most likely means $HOME/.vim/plugin/ and
$HOME/.vim/doc/ respectively.

If you have a clone of the QuickFix Manager Git repository, you may add the
path to it into 'runtimepath'. Here's an example what you could put into your
|vimrc| if you'd like to do that: >

  let &runtimepath = &runtimepath . ',' . '/path/to/cloned/repo/'

After installation, don't forget to run |:helptags| to generate help tags
files, to includes help tags for this plugin. Here's an example of how to run
this command: >

  :helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc


==============================================================================
4. Usage                                                        *qfmngr-usage*

Save a QuickFix list~

For saving the current QuickFix list, call the QuickFix Manager's save
function like this: >

  :call QFMNGR_SaveQuickFix()

When you do so, you will be asked to input a save name, i.e. a name that
identifies that particular list you are about to save. Any group of white
spaces you put into the name, will be replaced by an underscore. Legal
characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and underscore.

The QuickFix list will be stored in a text file on disk, in the directory
specified by global variable g:qfmngr_storageLocation. You may change the
default value of this variable (see |qfmngr-configuration| on how to do it).

The text files are named according to this pattern: >

  qfmngr_<name>.txt

Load a QuickFix list~

For Loading a QuickFix list, call the QuickFix Manager's load function like
this: >

  :call QFMNGR_LoadQuickFix()

The plugin will look for QuickFix lists in the directory specified by
g:qfmngr_storageLocation. You will be presented by a list of available ones to
select from. Make your choice and the chosen list will be loaded.


==============================================================================
5. Configuration                                        *qfmngr-configuration*

Storage location~

The plugin stores QuickFix lists onto disk. For the plugin to know where to
store those files, it uses the following global variable: >

  g:qfmngr_storageLocation

Default value is "/tmp/". To set another value, put this line of code into
your |vimrc|: >

  let g:qfmngr_storageLocation = "/some/other/path/"

Mappings~

It is a good idea to map keys for the two functions explained in
|qfmngr-usage|. For general information about mapping keys, see |key-mapping|.

Here is one mapping example of what you could put into your |vimrc|: >

  nnoremap <silent> <F2> :call QFMNGR_SaveQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> <F3> :call QFMNGR_LoadQuickFix()<CR>

With these two mappings, the F2 key would run the save QuickFix list function,
while F3 will run the load function.

Here's another mapping example: >

  nnoremap <Leader>qs :call QFMNGR_SaveQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <Leader>ql :call QFMNGR_LoadQuickFix()()<CR>

With the above mapping, the |<Leader>| key followed by either qs or ql is used
to call the save and load functions respectively. The leader key is by default
set to backslash (\).
