1. Introduction                                          *qfmngr-introduction*

The QuickFix Manager plugin provides a simple user interface for creating
custom-made QuickFix lists. What it means is that it gives you an easy way of
adding entries into the current QuickFix list. The entry added will consist of
the cursor's current position (filename + line number). It will also be tagged
with the text of the current line or any descriptive text you input yourself.

The QuickFix Manager plugin also provides a simple way of saving and loading
QuickFix lists to/from disk.

So, if you have filled up a QuickFix list (by using this plugin's add feature
for building up a list by yourselves or by the result of e.g. a compilation or
a grep) and want to access it at a later time, you can, with help of this
plugin, save it to disk into a text file. While saving, you give it a save
name, so you easily can identify each saved QuickFix list when you want to
load them later.

Vim does have built-in support for remembering multiple QuickFix lists, but
only up to ten lists, and you cannot give them individual names, so it's
harder to keep track of what's in what list. A bit rudimentary so to speak.

For general information about QuickFix, go here: |quickfix|

See |quickfix-error-lists| for more information about Vim's built-in support
of multiple QuickFix lists.


==============================================================================
2. Requirements                                          *qfmngr-requirements*

This plugin has been tested with Vim 7.3 in a Linux environment. Only the
regular text-based Vim has been used in this testing, not gVim. There are
probably no special requirements for this plugin to work.


==============================================================================
3. Installation                                          *qfmngr-installation*

The installation of this plugin is simple. The official guidelines are found
here: |add-global-plugin|

In an essence, you need to copy qfmngr.vim (the actual plugin code) and
qfmngr.txt (the help file) to somewhere in your |'runtimepath'|. For a
standard Unix environment, this most likely means $HOME/.vim/plugin/ and
$HOME/.vim/doc/ respectively.

If you have a clone of the QuickFix Manager Git repository, you may add the
path to it into 'runtimepath'. Here's an example what you could put into your
|vimrc| if you'd like to do that: >

  let &runtimepath = &runtimepath . ',' . '/path/to/cloned/repo/'

After installation, don't forget to run |:helptags| to generate help tags
files, to includes help tags for this plugin. Here's an example of how to run
this command: >

  :helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc


==============================================================================
4. Usage                                                        *qfmngr-usage*

Add an entry into the current QuickFix list~

For adding the current position of the cursor into the current QuickFix list,
call the QuickFix Manager's add function: >

  :call QFMNGR_AddToQuickFix()

You will be prompted with three choices:

  (a) Either you enter a descriptive text for this entry and then presses
      <enter>; or

  (b) You just presses <enter> to accept the text of the line which is under
      the cursor; or

  (c) Cancels the add operation altogether by entering the word "CANCEL"
      followed by an <enter>.

If you do not do (c), one entry will be added into the current QuickFix list.
The entry will contain the filename (plus its full path) and the line number
of the cursor's current position. It will also contain a tag, which is either
your own text (a) or what was under the cursor (b).

Clear the current QuickFix list~

For clearing (emptying) the current QuickFix list, call the QuickFix Manager's
clear function: >

  :call QFMNGR_ClearQuickFix()

Save a QuickFix list~

For saving the current QuickFix list, call the QuickFix Manager's save
function like this: >

  :call QFMNGR_SaveQuickFix()

When you do so, you will be asked to input a save name, i.e. a name that
identifies that particular list you are about to save. Any group of white
spaces you put into the name, will be replaced by an underscore. Legal
characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and underscore.

The QuickFix list will be stored in a text file on disk, in the directory
specified by global variable g:qfmngr_storageLocation. You may change the
default value of this variable (see |qfmngr-configuration| on how to do it).

The text files are named according to this pattern: >

  qfmngr_<name>.txt

Load a QuickFix list~

For Loading a QuickFix list, call the QuickFix Manager's load function like
this: >

  :call QFMNGR_LoadQuickFix()

The plugin will look for QuickFix lists in the directory specified by
g:qfmngr_storageLocation. You will be presented by a list of available ones to
select from. Make your choice and the chosen list will be loaded.


==============================================================================
5. Configuration                                        *qfmngr-configuration*

Storage location~

The plugin stores QuickFix lists onto disk. For the plugin to know where to
store those files, it uses the following global variable: >

  g:qfmngr_storageLocation

Default value is "/tmp/". To set another value, put this line of code into
your |vimrc|: >

  let g:qfmngr_storageLocation = "/some/other/path/"

Mappings~

It is a good idea to map keys for the four functions explained in
|qfmngr-usage|. For general information about mapping keys, see |key-mapping|.

Here are some mapping examples of what you could put into your |vimrc|: >

  nnoremap <silent> <F5> :call QFMNGR_AddToQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> <F6> :call QFMNGR_ClearQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> <F7> :call QFMNGR_SaveQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> <F8> :call QFMNGR_LoadQuickFix()<CR>

With these four mappings, the F5 key would run the add to QuickFix list
function, the F6 key would run the clear list function, the F7 key would run
the save function, while the F8 key would run the load function.

Here are some other mapping examples: >

  nnoremap <Leader>qa :call QFMNGR_AddToQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <Leader>qc :call QFMNGR_ClearQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <Leader>qs :call QFMNGR_SaveQuickFix()<CR>
  nnoremap <Leader>ql :call QFMNGR_LoadQuickFix()<CR>

With the above mapping, the |<Leader>| key followed by either qa, qc, qs or ql
is used to call the add, clear, save and load functions respectively. The
leader key is by default set to backslash (\).
